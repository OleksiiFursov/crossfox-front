## What does it do?

1. **Support HTML5 (for ~5% of old browsers):**

	 This CSS includes styles to support HTML5 elements, ensuring that they are displayed correctly in older browsers that may not inherently recognize these elements.


1. **Fix hr and abbr:**

	 Specific styles are applied to the `<hr>` (horizontal rule) and `<abbr>` (abbreviation) elements to adjust their appearance and behavior.


1. **Remove margin (for body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, dl, dd, blockquote, ul, ol, figure):**

	 The margin is reset to zero for various HTML elements. This removes any default spacing that browsers might apply to these elements.


1. **Add styles for tags (box-sizing, background-repeat, vertical-align):**

	 These CSS properties are applied to all HTML elements, improving their rendering and layout. `box-sizing: border-box;` is especially useful for consistent box sizing.


1. **Remove styles for focus and active states:**

	 Any default styles for focus and active states (such as outlines) are removed, ensuring a cleaner appearance for these states.


1. **Fix 'hidden' attribute and the 'template' tag:**

	 Styles are added to properly handle the 'hidden' attribute and the 'template' tag, ensuring that elements with these attributes are hidden as intended.


1. **Reset default styles for tags (a, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, cite, address, blockquote, ul, ol):**

	 Default styles for these elements are reset, allowing developers to apply custom styles without interference from browser defaults.


1. **Add (overflow-wrap: break-word;) for h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p:**

	 This CSS rule ensures that long words within heading and paragraph elements are broken into multiple lines, preventing them from overflowing their containers.


1. **Change rem to 10px:**

	 The base font size is set to 10px. This can simplify font size calculations, as 1rem will now equal 10px.


1. **Add rules for smoother rendering:**

	 Various CSS properties are set to improve text rendering, including antialiasing and text-decoration handling.


1. **Add (min-height: 100%) for body + fix for iOS:**

	 The min-height of the <body> element is set to 100%, ensuring that the page occupies the full height of the viewport. The -webkit-fill-available property is also added for iOS compatibility, ensuring correct functionality.


1. **Normalize tables. Add (border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0;):**

	 This normalizes the rendering of HTML tables by setting `border-collapse` to 'collapse' and `border-spacing` to '0', removing any spacing between table cells.


1. **Add a mode without animations:**

	 This CSS code provides a mode without animations, which can be useful for users who prefer reduced motion or for specific design considerations where animations are not desired.


1. **Other**

	 In addition, there are some minor rules for the correct or improved display of the page
